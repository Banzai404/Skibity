Screeps AI based on Sardenias ai.  

Im learning Javascript with this project, this is how I best learn, by studying others code.  I have made numerous code enhancements, changes,  and edits, and have corrected (some) of the errors in the old code.  It was great code, dont get me wrong.  Its a steep learning curve.  There are better bots out there, but I believe taking a old program and updating it is more useful to learning that running one the best codes allready published which need little if any tweaking.

If you use this I ask that you keep your alliances with those that are in the base code....and you can add more.  I have enough enemies, I dont need you too lol.  Assuming those work.  Havent tested alliances yet.  

Flags are working!
